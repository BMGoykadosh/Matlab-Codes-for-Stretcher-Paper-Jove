Cell Stretcher Image Analysis Codes

Overview
This collection of MATLAB codes performs image analysis for cell stretching experiments, including rigid body shift correction, displacement/strain field calculation, and traction force microscopy (TFM) analysis.

Setup Requirements:
Important: The folder titled "traction codes" must be added to your MATLAB path before running any analysis.

The following codes are the ones you will be interfacing with. They are contained in the folder "Stretcher Codes"

Code Descriptions
Rigid Body Shift (RBS) Correction
These codes must be run first before any other analysis.

rbs_correction_stretcher - Main script for rigid body shift correction
rbs_correction_function_stretcher - Supporting function for RBS correction

Analysis Pipelines
After RBS correction, you can proceed with one of two types of analysis 

Option 1: Displacement and Strain Field Analysis

stretcher_disp_strain_stress_2 - Main script to calculate displacement and strain fields
Sam_beads_imcorr_v2_stretcher - Supporting function for displacement and strain calculations

Option 2: Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) Analysis

disp_trac_code_stretcher - Main script to calculate displacements and tractions for TFM experiments
comment_Sam_beads_imcorr_v2_stretcher_test - Supporting function for TFM calculations
cell_force_stretcher_test - Calculates average traction forces over a specified area (run after disp_trac_code_stretcher)

Hardware Control

stretcher code (Arduino) - Controls the Arduino board that drives motor movement for the stretching device


First, run the rigid body shift correction using rbs_correction_stretcher (which calls rbs_correction_function_stretcher). This step is required before any other analysis.
After RBS correction, you can proceed with one of two analysis pathways depending on your needs. For displacement and strain field analysis, run stretcher_disp_strain_stress_2 (which calls Sam_beads_imcorr_v2_stretcher). Alternatively, for traction force microscopy analysis, run disp_trac_code_stretcher (which calls comment_Sam_beads_imcorr_v2_stretcher_test), then run cell_force_stretcher_test to calculate average traction forces over a specified area.

Usage Notes
Each code file contains detailed comments explaining how to run it. Please refer to the individual file headers for specific instructions on input parameters and data formatting.
